# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This repository is the **PrecisionScaleController** project — software for controlling a Sartorius Entris-II precision balance. It also carries the project-wide Claude Code conventions originally inherited from CommonClaude; this `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical ruleset (there is no separate `CommonClaude.md`).

## Files in this repo

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | This file — full rules and workflow (§1–§17) |
| [`ToDo.md`](ToDo.md) | Append-only cumulative task log (§4) |
| [`LearnedPatterns.md`](LearnedPatterns.md) | Patterns extracted from completed tasks (§9) |
| [`README.md`](README.md) | Public-facing summary of conventions |
| [`ruff.toml`](ruff.toml) | Ruff lint/format config (80-col, 4-space, E/F/W/I/N) |
| [`.claude/`](.claude/) | Hooks (`hooks/`) and harness config (`settings.json`) |
| `*.pdf` (root) | Sartorius Entris-II reference material (§7 sources) |

## Environment

This project runs inside a **Docker container** with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as the primary development tool.

| Item              | Detail                                                              |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Runtime           | Docker container (`--privileged`)                                   |
| OS                | Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)                                                |
| Dev tool          | Claude Code (CLI / VS Code extension)                               |
| Required pkgs     | `jq` (`apt install -y jq`) — hooks no-op without it (see LP §Q1/§E2)|

The harness `env` block lives in [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json):

- `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000` — bounds extended-reasoning length per turn
- `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=50` — triggers context autocompaction at 50%

## Commands

| Purpose                     | Command                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Lint a Python file          | `ruff check <file>.py`                           |
| Check formatting            | `ruff format --check <file>.py`                  |
| Auto-format                 | `ruff format <file>.py`                          |
| Open / update a task issue  | `gh issue create` / `gh issue edit`              |
| Open a PR                   | `gh pr create` (template in §15.2)               |

There is no build system, test runner, or package manifest yet — `tests/` and `claude_test/` directories do not exist. Create them on demand per §3 Debug File Management.

## 1. Rule Priority

Project-level `CLAUDE.md` files take precedence over this global ruleset. Specific rules beat general ones. When a conflict arises, the more-specific context wins.

---

## 2. MIT Code Convention

All code follows the [MIT CommLab Coding and Comment Style](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/coding-and-comment-style/).

### Naming

- **Variables and classes** are nouns; **functions and methods** are verbs.
- Names must be pronounceable and straightforward.
- Name length is proportional to scope: short for local, descriptive for broad.
- Avoid abbreviations unless self-explanatory. If unavoidable, define them in a comment block.
- Python conventions:

| Element    | Style        | Example               |
|------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Variable   | `lower_case` | `joint_angle`         |
| Function   | `lower_case` | `send_action`         |
| Class      | `CamelCase`  | `FairinoFollower`     |
| Constant   | `lower_case` | `_settle_mid_s`       |
| Module     | `lowercase`  | `fairino_follower`    |

### Structure

- **80-column limit** for all new code.
- One statement per line.
- Indent with **4 spaces** (never tabs).
- Place operators on the **left side** of continuation lines so the reader can see at a glance that a line continues.
- Group related items visually with alignment.

### Spacing

- One space after commas, none before: `foo(a, b, c)`.
- One space on each side of `=`, `==`, `<`, `>`, etc.
- Be consistent with arithmetic operators within a file.

### Comments

- Use **complete sentences**.
- Only comment for **context** or **non-obvious choices**. Never restate what the code already says.
- Outdated comments are worse than none. Keep them current or delete them.
- TODO format:
  ```python
  # TODO: (@owner) Implement 2-step predictor-corrector
  # for stability. Adams-Bashforth causes shocks.
  ```

### Language

- All code comments, docstrings, commit messages, documentation files (including README), **GitHub issues, and pull requests** must be written in **English**.

### Documentation

- All public functions and classes must have **docstrings** (PEP 257 / Google style).
- A docstring states **what** and **why**, not **how**.
- Include `Args:`, `Returns:`, and `Raises:` sections when applicable.

---

## 3. Debug File Management

All debug, exploratory, and throwaway test scripts must be saved in `claude_test/`, **not** in `tests/`.

### Rules

| Location        | What goes there                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `tests/`        | Production-quality tests that are part of CI/CD.     |
| `claude_test/`  | Debug scripts, one-off experiments, diagnostic code. |

### When writing debug code

1. Create the file directly in `claude_test/` (e.g., `claude_test/debug_servo_timing.py`).
2. Add a one-line docstring at the top explaining the purpose.
3. If the debug script leads to a real fix, move the relevant parts into a proper test under `tests/` and delete or archive the debug version.

### README

`claude_test/README.md` is the index. When adding a new debug file, add a row to the table in that README describing what the file does and what was learned.

---

## 4. Task Management

> **MANDATORY**: This workflow applies to **every task without exception**, regardless of size or complexity. No task may begin without writing `ToDo.md` and creating a GitHub issue via `gh`. Skipping any step is not allowed.

### Rules

1. **Write ToDo.md**: For every task requested by the user, create a `ToDo.md` file and confirm the contents with the user before starting work.
2. **Accumulate ToDo.md**: Do not overwrite previous entries in `ToDo.md`. Always **append** new tasks below existing ones so that the file serves as a cumulative command history for Claude's actions.
3. **Register GitHub issues**: When possible, use the `gh` CLI to register the Todo list and details as a GitHub issue.

### Command Input Validation

Before writing ToDo.md, the following two checks must be performed:

1. **Is the command explicit?**: If the request is ambiguous or open to interpretation, do not start work. Instead, ask the user for specifics:
   - What is being changed? (target)
   - How is it being changed? (method)
   - Why is it being changed? (purpose)
2. **Are there reference materials?**: Check whether related PDFs, websites, or documents exist. If so, review them before incorporating into the work.

> Do not proceed if either check is not satisfied.

### Workflow

1. Receive the user's task request and **validate the command input**.
2. Once validated, organize the task list in `ToDo.md`.
3. Get the user's confirmation on the `ToDo.md` contents.
4. Once confirmed, create a GitHub issue via `gh issue create`.
5. Cut a working branch from `main` using `<type>/<short-description>` naming (see §12.2).
6. Check off completed items in `ToDo.md` as work progresses; every commit follows the Conventional Commits format (see §11).
7. Update the GitHub issue via `gh issue edit` for completed items.
8. Push the branch to remote.
9. After work is complete, open a PR via `gh pr create` using the template in §15.2.
10. After the PR is merged, delete the local branch.

> **Reminder**: Steps 2 (`ToDo.md`), 4 (`gh issue create`), 5 (working branch), and 9 (PR) are **non-negotiable** for any task that touches code or documentation. Every task must have a corresponding `ToDo.md` entry, a GitHub issue, a dedicated branch, and a PR.

> **Enforcement**: The Stop prompt hook configured in [`.claude/settings.json`](.claude/settings.json) blocks session end if a `ToDo.md` entry or matching GitHub issue is missing. A Stop-hook failure is the symptom of skipping Rule 1 or Rule 3 above, not a bug.

---

## 5. Testing Rules

Tests exist to verify the **correctness and quality** of code. Code quality must never be sacrificed just to pass tests.

### Rules

1. **No magic numbers**: Do not use arbitrary numbers or values directly to pass tests. All values must be defined as meaningful constants or variables.
   ```python
   # Bad: passing tests with magic numbers
   def calculate_area(radius):
       return 3.14 * radius * radius  # Why 3.14?

   # Good: use meaningful constants
   import math

   def calculate_area(radius):
       return math.pi * radius * radius
   ```

2. **No hardcoding**: Do not hardcode values to match expected test results. Code must work through correct logic, not through branches or fixed values tailored to specific inputs.
   ```python
   # Bad: hardcoded to match test inputs
   def convert_temperature(celsius):
       if celsius == 100:
           return 212
       if celsius == 0:
           return 32
       return celsius * 1.8 + 32

   # Good: correct logic implementation
   def convert_temperature(celsius):
       return celsius * 1.8 + 32
   ```

3. **Code quality first**: Prioritize readability, maintainability, and correctness over whether tests pass. If a test fails, fix the logic correctly rather than tricking the test.

---

## 6. Linting

All Python code must pass **Ruff** checks before committing.

### Rules

1. **Line length**: 80 columns (`line-length = 80` in `ruff.toml`).
2. **Run on every commit**: Before committing, run:
   ```bash
   ruff check <file>.py
   ruff format --check <file>.py
   ```
3. **Fix before committing**: If either command reports errors, fix them before proceeding. Use `ruff format <file>.py` to auto-format.

---

## 7. Research Before Coding

Before calling into an unfamiliar library, API, or CLI, verify its actual interface rather than guessing from memory.

### Rules

1. **Consult official documentation first** via Context7 MCP or web search.
2. **Search the repository** for prior implementations before writing new code against the same interface.
3. **Trust documentation over intuition**: when the docs disagree with the mental model, update the mental model.

---

## 8. Exceptions

The rules above are written for production code and CI tests. The following contexts receive formal waivers.

### `claude_test/` scripts

Scripts inside `claude_test/` are exempt from:

- The 80-column line limit (§2 Structure).
- Mandatory docstrings on public functions and classes (§2 Documentation).

Rationale: `claude_test/` is a scratch area for one-off diagnostics where strict readability conventions slow exploration. Anything later promoted into `tests/` must conform fully.

### One-off exploratory analysis

Exploratory or analysis scripts (typically under `claude_test/`) may use numeric literals directly, provided the file opens with a short intent comment explaining purpose and expected lifetime. This waiver does not apply to code under `tests/` or to production modules.

### `ToDo.md` checkbox updates

Marking completion checkboxes in `ToDo.md` (flipping `- [ ]` to `- [x]`, or appending a commit hash or issue link to a completed line) is permitted. The append-only rule in §4 Task Management Rule 2 and the "do not modify `ToDo.md`" constraint in §10 Learned Patterns Bootstrap forbid prose rewrites, reordering of entries, and deletion of historical items — not progress marking.

---

## 9. Learned Patterns Reference

When `LearnedPatterns.md` exists, treat it as part of the workflow. The file captures lessons from past work so they can be reused rather than rediscovered.

### Rules

1. **Before drafting `ToDo.md`**, read the sections of `LearnedPatterns.md` relevant to the new task. Relevance can be filtered by library, environment, or the general problem domain.
2. **Reference applicable patterns in the ToDo entry** using `(see LP §X)` where `X` is the section of `LearnedPatterns.md` being cited. Example:
   ```
   - [ ] Connect to device over serial (see LP §3)
   ```
3. **After the task completes**, if a new recurring issue, gotcha, library quirk, workflow lesson, or environment-specific note surfaced, append it to the correct section of `LearnedPatterns.md`. Use the Problem / Cause / Fix / Rule format specified in §10 Learned Patterns Bootstrap.
4. **Promote stable patterns**: entries in `LearnedPatterns.md` that stabilize across many tasks should be lifted into a formal rule inside this `CLAUDE.md`. Remove the promoted entry from `LearnedPatterns.md` to avoid duplication.

---

## 10. Learned Patterns Bootstrap

> **Status (2026-05-19):** Bootstrap satisfied — [`LearnedPatterns.md`](LearnedPatterns.md) already exists with 15 patterns across §1–§5 plus §99. New sessions should follow §9 (Reference) and skip the procedure below unless the file is deleted.

If `LearnedPatterns.md` does not exist in the repository root, generate it by analyzing the `Completed` items in `ToDo.md` using the procedure below. Once the file exists, this bootstrap procedure no longer applies — consult the file directly.

### Procedure

1. Read every `[x]` item across all sections in `ToDo.md`.
2. Classify each item into exactly one of the following categories:
   - **§1. Recurring Issues** — the same or a similar problem appeared **two or more times**.
   - **§2. Solved Gotchas** — a one-time trap with a credible chance of recurring.
   - **§3. Library Quirks** — hidden or surprising behavior of a specific library or tool.
   - **§4. Workflow Lessons** — lessons learned about the development or collaboration process itself.
   - **§5. Environment Specifics** — Docker, Ubuntu, or hardware-specific notes.
3. Items that do not cleanly fit any category go into **§99. Uncategorized**. Do **not** discard them.
4. For each entry, record four single-line fields:
   - **Problem**: what went wrong.
   - **Cause**: the underlying reason.
   - **Fix**: the specific change that resolved it.
   - **Rule**: a short general directive in `Always ...` or `Never ...` form.
5. Append `(from ToDo#N)` at the end of each entry, where `N` identifies the source ToDo item, so the original record can be recovered on later review.

### Constraints

- **Do not modify `ToDo.md`.** It is append-only; edits happen only in `LearnedPatterns.md`.
- **Create `LearnedPatterns.md` as a new file** in the repository root. Do not inline patterns into `ToDo.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Do not invent patterns.** When a ToDo item is ambiguous, place it under §99 rather than guessing.
- **Write all content in English**, consistent with §2 Language rule.

## 11. Commit Messages

Follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. The English-only rule for commit messages, PR titles, and PR bodies follows §2 Language.

### 11.1 Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### 11.2 Types

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Adding or modifying tests |
| `chore` | Build config, .gitignore, etc. |
| `style` | Formatting only (no behavior change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |

### 11.3 Rules

- Description in **imperative mood**: "Add", "Fix" (NOT "Added", "Fixed")
- Subject line **under 50 characters**
- **No period** at the end of the subject line
- Wrap body at 72 characters
- Body explains **"what and why"** (the code shows "how")
- Keep scope short and focused on the affected area (e.g., `parser`, `core`, `build`)

### 11.4 Examples

```
feat(parser): add JSON config loader in Python

Adds JSON format support alongside the existing INI files.
Uses only the standard library — no external dependencies.
```

```
fix(core): prevent buffer overflow in tokenize()
```

```
chore(build): update Makefile for new module
```

### 11.5 Breaking Changes

Mark backward-incompatible changes with `!` or a footer:

```
feat(api)!: change return type of parse() to dict

BREAKING CHANGE: parse() previously returned a tuple;
it now returns a dict.
```

## 12. Branching Strategy

Adopt **GitHub Flow** — a lightweight single-main-branch strategy.

### 12.1 Principles

- `main` is **always in a deployable state**
- Work happens on **separate branches** cut from `main`
- Changes are merged into `main` via **Pull Requests**
- **Delete branches after merging**
- **Open PRs even when working solo** (for self-review and history tracking)

### 12.2 Branch Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Examples:
- `feature/csv-parser`
- `feature/python-bindings`
- `fix/memory-leak-in-loader`
- `fix/issue-42`
- `refactor/error-handling`
- `docs/api-reference`

### 12.3 Standard Workflow

```bash
# 1. Get latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a working branch
git checkout -b feature/csv-parser

# 3. Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(parser): add CSV reader"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin feature/csv-parser

# 5. Open a PR on GitHub → review → merge

# 6. Clean up locally after merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/csv-parser
```

## 13. .gitignore

Cover both C and Python. Combine GitHub's official templates.

### 13.1 Base Template

```gitignore
# ===== C =====
*.o
*.a
*.so
*.dylib
*.exe
*.out
*.app
*.dSYM/
build/
bin/

# ===== Python =====
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.Python
.venv/
venv/
env/
*.egg-info/
dist/
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
.mypy_cache/

# ===== Editor / OS =====
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# ===== Secrets =====
.env
.env.local
*.key
*.pem
```

### 13.2 Global .gitignore

Keep OS/editor-specific files in a personal `~/.gitignore_global`:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

> **Sources**:
> - [GitHub Official .gitignore Template (C)](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/C.gitignore)
> - [GitHub Official .gitignore Template (Python)](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore)

---

## 14. Versioning

Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.

### 14.1 Format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

| Component | When to increment |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Backward-incompatible changes |
| **MINOR** | Backward-compatible new features |
| **PATCH** | Backward-compatible bug fixes |

### 14.2 Mapping to Conventional Commits

- `fix:` → **PATCH** bump
- `feat:` → **MINOR** bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE` → **MAJOR** bump

### 14.3 Tagging

```bash
# Create an annotated tag (recommended)
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"

# Push the tag
git push origin v0.1.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

### 14.4 Initial Development

- `0.y.z` is for initial development — the public API is considered unstable
- The first stable release should be `1.0.0`

> **Source**: [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

---

## 15. Pull Request Guidelines

### 15.1 Title

Use the same Conventional Commits format as commit messages:

```
feat(parser): add JSON config loader
```

### 15.2 Description Template

```markdown
## Changes
- Brief summary of what changed

## Why
- Motivation behind the change

## Testing
- How the change was verified (added tests, manual testing, etc.)

## Related Issues
Closes #42
```

### 15.3 Size

- Keep PRs **under 400 lines** when possible (for effective review)
- Split large changes into multiple PRs

---

## 16. Git Automation (Optional)

Use **pre-commit** for automated style checks and formatting.

### 16.1 Installation

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### 16.2 Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files

  # Python
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
      - id: ruff-format

  # C
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-clang-format
    rev: v18.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: clang-format
```

### 16.3 Enable Hooks

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Checks and formatting will now run automatically on `git commit`.
